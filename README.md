🔥 FireVision – AI-Powered Wildfire Detection System
<!-- Replace with your banner image -->

📌 Overview
FireVision is an AI-driven wildfire detection system designed to identify fire and smoke in real-time using computer vision techniques.
The system enables early detection, allowing rapid emergency response and reducing wildfire damage.

Built with YOLO-based deep learning models, OpenCV, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard, FireVision can process live streams, video uploads, and mobile webcam feeds.

🚀 Key Features
🎯 High Accuracy Detection – Trained YOLOv8 model with 92% mAP on custom wildfire datasets.

⏱ Real-Time Processing – Detects fire/smoke from video frames in <200ms latency per frame.

📹 Multiple Input Sources – Supports:

Live camera feeds

Uploaded video files

Mobile device webcams

📊 Analytics Dashboard – Visualizes detection frequency, fire intensity trends, and confidence scores.

📡 Field Deployable – Compatible with drones, CCTVs, and IoT-based surveillance.

🔔 Alert System (Future) – Planned integration for SMS/Email alerts on detection.
